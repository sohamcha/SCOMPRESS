SCOMPRESS - The General Purpose Compression Utility

7/17/2011
v 0.6 Beta Release

This program is developed by Soham Chakraborty. The project started as a College Project but later
 became more important than that!!!!   :)
This Program uses Both RUN LENGTH ENCODING and LEMPEL-ZIV-WELCH Algorithms using BWT for General Purpose Text compressions
 .

SOME MINOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE : 

1) INCLUSION of NUMBERS and any other special Characters in the Encoding Message Body. !

2) Less memory Requirements by utilizing memset().

3) Variable SIZE Dictionary with INDEX DELIMITER ( Any Compressible FILESIZE! big improvement!!!).  :D

4) Many other CODING OPTIMIZATIONS.  .  .

However, some of the Shortcomings in this Alpha release still remains :



1) The CHUNK Fragmentation service of Huge Files is dropped in this release for simplicity and testing purpose.
 I will be adding that in future releases.

Trying to find better ADT to represent the LZW dictionary.




thank you for trying this software.
Suggestions are always Welcomed!!!!!
